## v1.5: "Tensa Zangetsu"
In this new update, we've added a new feature to automatically download new epiodoes of the anime you are currently following.<br /><br />
Lets say you are watching [Kakushigoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakushigoto:_My_Dad%27s_Secret_Ambition) this season, you watched till episode 5 but new ones have released and you want to watch that. 
But its pretty tiresome to go and check online if a new episode has released or not and if it has, go to some site and download it.<br /><br />
Thats where **Tensa Zangetsu** comes to the resuce! It automatically scrapes the web and checks if a new episode has released or not.
And if it has, it gives you the option to download and add the torrent to your torrent app.
