# Anime-Tracker
## About
A Python app to keep track of your anime progress.
## Description
It's pretty hard to keep track of anime these days. For Otakus like me who watch around 5-10 anime per season, its quite difficult to remember which episode it was the previous week. Was it ep 7? Or was it 6? 

## Versions

### v1.0: "Zangetsu"
A simple command-line app that uses a text file as the database.
