# Anime-Tracker
## About
A Python app to keep track of your anime progress.
## Description
It's pretty hard to keep track of anime these days. For Otakus like me who watch around 5-10 anime per season, its quite difficult to remember which episode it was the previous week. Was it ep 7? Or was it 6? ðŸ¤”

## Versions
